[about the design]
> It's maybe the fourth version of my website. First one I feel comfy publishing when I get to it. Feels good to make something that doesn't look like next cookie-cutter tech startup website, but instead shoddy and inspired by Gameboy. Here's a question: does this website look unwieldy, or am I brainwashed by the endless stream of samey websites and anything looking different immediately feels off? Anyway, until the next version, design stays.
