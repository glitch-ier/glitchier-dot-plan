[personal website]

+ I finally managed to put together something that I could call a v0.1.0 of my personal blog.
+ Added a script to pull the latest .plan file, cache it, and render on the home page.
+ Added some initial content as well.

* This is maybe fourth version of my website and first one I feel comfortable publishing (when I finally get to it, of course). Anything before I tried to make look good, but it always circled back to either using a framework like bootstrap or bulma, or mimicking it. And then I felt like my blog looks like some cookie-cutter startup website. Current design looks... shoddy. It's inspired by the Gameboy handheld, and it reeks of "90s creative website design" which feels off-putting to me. But why? Is the design really this unwieldy, or am I just brainwashed by the endless stream of samey websites and anything that is different immediately feels off? Anyway, until next version, this design stays.
